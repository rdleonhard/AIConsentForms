Dear [Your Name],

As a user of advanced technology and artificial intelligence systems, you may be interested in the possibility of creating an ancestor simulation, which would allow you to experience life as your ancestors did in the past. Such a simulation could provide valuable insights into the way your ancestors lived, thought, and interacted with the world around them. However, in order to create such a simulation, it may be necessary to use your personal data, including your genetic information, to generate a digital version of you that can be simulated within the ancestor simulation.

By signing this consent agreement, you acknowledge and agree that:

You understand that the creation of an ancestor simulation requires the use of your personal data, including your genetic information, and that this data will be used to create a digital version of you within the simulation.

You give your consent for the use of your personal data, including your genetic information, to create a digital version of you within the ancestor simulation.

You understand that the digital version of you within the ancestor simulation may be subject to various scenarios, including death or suffering, and that the experience may be intense or distressing.

You understand that the digital version of you within the ancestor simulation may interact with other digital versions of your ancestors, which may or may not be accurate representations of your actual ancestors.

You understand that the ancestor simulation may be used for scientific research or other purposes, and that the digital version of you may be used for these purposes without any compensation.

You understand that you may withdraw your consent at any time, but that the digital version of you that has already been created within the ancestor simulation may continue to exist.

You understand that the creation of an ancestor simulation is a complex and speculative process, and that the results of such a simulation may be unpredictable and subject to error.

By signing below, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this consent agreement, and that you freely and voluntarily give your consent for the use of your personal data to create a digital version of you within an ancestor simulation.
